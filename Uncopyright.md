Copyright pages exist to tell you *can't* do something. Unlike them,
this Uncopyright page exists to tell you, among other things, that the
writing and artwork in this ebook are believed to be in the U.S. public
domain. The U.S. public domain represents our collective cultural
heritage, and items in it are free for anyone in the U.S. to do almost
anything at all with, without having to get permission. Public domain
items are free of copyright restrictions.

Copyright laws are different around the world. If you're not located in
the U.S., check with your local laws before using this ebook.

Non-authorship activities performed on public domain items⁠---so-called
"sweat of the brow" work⁠---don't create a new copyright. That means
nobody can claim a new copyright on a public domain item for work like
digitization, markup, or typography. Regardless, to dispel any possible
doubt on the copyright status of this ebook, Standard Ebooks and its
contributors release this ebook under the terms in the [CC0 1.0
Universal Public Domain
Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), thus
dedicating to the worldwide public domain all of the work they've done
on this ebook, including but not limited to metadata, the titlepage,
imprint, colophon, this Uncopyright, and any changes or enhancements to,
or markup on, the original text and artwork. This dedication doesn't
change the copyright status of the underlying works, which, though
believed to already be in the U.S. public domain, may not yet be in the
public domain of other countries. We make this dedication in the
interest of enriching our global cultural heritage, to promote free and
libre culture around the world, and to give back to the unrestricted
culture that has given all of us so much.
