**Everything You Ever Really Needed to Know About Personal Finance On Just One Page My Story**

I was born in raised in downstate rural Illinois. Growing up, my family didnʼt have a lot [of money \[1\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/10/31/the-road-to-financial-armageddon-1-the-earliest-mistakes/), but they did have a lot of love. They taught me the value of living frugally [\[2\]]<!--more-->(http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/04/30/five-frugal-lessons-from-my-parents/), but it wasnʼt always coupled with great financial lessons. In short, I had little idea how to manage my own money, and when I left home for college, I made a long [sequence of financial mistakes. \[3\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/11/02/the-road-to-financial-armageddon-3-cash-college/) Flash forward to April 2006.

To put it simply, I had a financial [meltdown \[4\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/11/08/the-road-to-financial-armageddon-8-meltdown/), capped off by a long night of soul searching while facing a pile of bills that I simply couldnʼt afford to pay [\[5\].](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/25/the-longest-night/) That experience woke me up. I dove into personal finance books, reading them by the [hundreds \[6\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/book-review-index/). I started throwing the book at our terrible financial state, trying every tactic that I read about. And it worked. Over the course of two years, we paid off two car loans, five figuresʼ worth of credit card debt, five figuresʼ worth of student loan debt, and several personal loans. This turnaround laid the foundation for many things we had only dreamed about to that point - we bought a home, had another child, built a strong emergency fund, and, eventually, I was able to change careers and become a writer, taking a pay drop but living out a dream Iʼd had since I was a child. How did I do it? The cover of this document tells the truth of the matter. Itʼs the blueprint for all of these great changes in my life. Want to know more? Letʼs go.
