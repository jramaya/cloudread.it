**1. Switch your bank accounts to a bank that respects you.**

You shouldnʼt be spending your hard-earned money on maintenance fees - you also should be earning some serious interest on your checking and savings accounts. I use ING Direct as my primary bank - I earn roughly 1% on my checking account and 1.4% on my savings account (even in this down economy) and theyʼve never dinged me with a fee. Itʼs not too hard to switch banks, either[, if you sit down and just do it. \[23\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/12/26/how-to-switch-to-a-new-checking-account/)

**2. Turn off the television.**

One big way to save money is to watch less television. There are a lot of [financial benefits to this \[24\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/09/ten-financial-reasons-to-turn-off-your-television-and-ten-things-to-replace-it-with/): less exposure to guilt-inducing ads, more time to focus on other things in life, less electrical use, and so on. Itʼs great to unwind in the evening, but seek another hobby to do that.

**3. Turn a critical eye to your "collections."**

Most people collect something - what do you collect? Is it something that consistently brings you joy? Or is it something that you just do out of habit at this point? Does the collection itself have value? Could you perhaps "trim the fat" from this collection by getting rid of duplicates or [getting rid of the items you no longer use \[25\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/01/26/a-media-collection-purge-a-great-way-to-free-up-some-extra-money-for-debt-payment-and-investments/)? Also, could you perhaps cut down on [your spending on that hobby \[26\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/11/13/evaluating-and-minimizing-hobby-expenses/)[, \[27\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/07/17/making-expensive-hobbies-more-financially-manageable/)? Focus on trimming the things you donʼt feel strongly about - if you dig into things that bother you, youʼre going to eventually relapse.

**4. Sign up for every free customer rewards program you can.**

Even if you rarely shop at that place, having a rewards card for that place will eventually net you some coupons and discounts. Hereʼs the basic game plan for maximizing these programs [\[28\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/19/five-minute-finances-13-sign-up-for-a-free-customer-rewards-program/): create a Gmail address just for these mailings, collect every card you can, and then check that account for extra coupons whenever youʼre ready to shop.

**5. Make your own gifts instead of buying stuff from the store.**

You can make food mixes, candles, bread, cookies, soap, and all kinds of other things at home quite easily [and inexpensively \[29\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/05/21/gifts-that-matter-dont-come-from-wal-mart/). These make spectacular gifts for others because they involve your homemade touch, plus quite often theyʼre consumable, meaning they donʼt wind up filling someoneʼs closet with junk. Even better - include a personal handwritten note with [the gift \[30\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/02/14/the-art-of-the-thank-you-note/). This will make it even more special than anything you could possibly buy down at the mall, plus it saves you money.

**6. Master the thirty day rule.**

Whenever youʼre considering making an unnecessary [purchase, wait thirty days and then ask yourself if you still want that item \[31\]](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2006/09/12/control-impulse-spending-with-the-30-day-rule/). Quite often, youʼll find that the urge to buy has passed and youʼll have saved yourself some money by simply waiting. If you want, you can even keep a "thirty day list" where you write down the item and the day youʼll reconsider it, but I prefer just to keep this one in my head - that way, I often just forget about the unimportant things.

**7. Write a list before you go shopping -and stick to it.**

One should never go into a store without a strong idea of what one will [be buying while in there \[32\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/11/02/zen-and-the-art-of-the-grocery-list/). Make a careful plan of what youʼll buy before you go, then stick strictly to that list when you go to the store. Donʼt put anything in the cart thatʼs not on the list, no matter how tempting, and youʼll come out of the store saving a bundle. A peek at my coupon binder - an effective way to use coupons. [\[33\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/06/13/how-we-organize-our-coupons-and-execute-our-coupon-strategy/)

**8. Invite friends over instead of going out**. Almost every activity at home is less expensive than going out. Invite some friends over and have a cookout or a potluck meal, then play some cards and have a few drinks. Everyone will have fun, the cost will be low, and the others will likely reciprocate not long afterwards.

**9. Instead of throwing out some damaged clothing, repair it instead.**

Donʼt toss out a shirt because of a broken button - sew a new one on with some closely-matched thread. Donʼt toss out pants because of a hole in them - put in a patch of some sort and save them for times when youʼre working around the house. Simple sewing can be done by anyone - it just takes a few minutes and it saves a lot of money by keeping you from buying new clothes when you donʼt really need to.

**10. Donʼt spend big money entertaining your children.**

Most children, especially young ones, can be entertained very cheaply. Buy them an end roll of newspaper from [your local paper \[34\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/09/11/fifteen-ways-to-have-cheap-fun-with-your-kids-using-a-1-end-roll-of-paper/) and let their creativity run wild. Make a game out of ordinary stuff around the house, like tossing pennies into a jar, even. Collect common household [items into a "rainy day" art box \[35\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/05/01/the-frugal-rainy-day-box/). Realize that what your children want most of all is your time, not your stuff, and youʼll find money in your pocket and joy in your heart.

**11. Call your credit card company and ask for a rate reduction.**

Take any of your credit cards that are carrying a balance, flip them over, and call the number on the back. Tell them that you want an interest rate reduction or youʼll take your business elsewhere. If the first person you talk to wonʼ[t do it, ask to talk to a supervisor \[36\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/03/09/a-step-by-step-guide-to-getting-your-credit-card-interest-rates-reduced/). If you have a \$5,000 balance, even a 3% rate reduction saves you \$150 a year.

**12. Clean out your closet.**

Go through your closets and try to get rid of some of the stuff in there. You can have a yard sale with it, take it to a consignment shop, or even donate it for the tax deduction - all of which turn old stuff you donʼt want to use any more into money in your pocket. Not only that, itʼs often a psychological load off your mind to clean out your closets.

**13. Buy games that have a lot of replay value - and donʼt acquire new ones untilyouʼve mastered what you have.**

[My video game buying habits \[37\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/01/21/video-games-and-frugality/) have changed quite a bit since my "game of the week" days. Now, I focus on games that can be played over and over and over again, and I focus on mastering the games that I buy. Good targets include puzzle games and long, involved quest games - they maximize the value of your gaming dollar. <amp-img width="256" height="192" layout="intrinsic" src="/assets/images/000002.png"></amp-img>

**14. Drink more water.**

Not only does drinking plenty of water have great health [benefits, water drinking has financial benefits, too \[38\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/02/five-minute-finances-6-drink-lots-of-water/). Drink a big glass of water before each meal, and not only will you digest it better, you wonʼt eat as much, saving on the olʼ food bill. Youʼll also find yourself feeling a bit better as you begin to get adequately hydrated (most Americans are perpetually somewhat dehydrated).

**15. Cut back on the conveniencefoods - fast foods, microwavemeals, and so on.**

Instead of eating fast food or just nuking some prepackaged food when you get home, try making some simple and healthy replacements that you can [take with you \[39\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2006/12/11/battling-the-convenience-and-costs-of-fast-food/), like homemade [bulk breakfast burritos \[40\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/02/20/bulk-breakfast-burritos-convenient-cheap-healthy-and-easier-than-you-think/).. An hourʼs worth of preparation one weekend can give you a ton of cheap and handy meals that will end up saving you a lot of cash and not eat into your time when youʼre busy.

**16. Give up expensive habits, like cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs.**

Those habits cause money to flow away from you with nothing in return. Call up your fortitude and work hard to kick the habits and youʼll find that money staying in your pocket instead of burning up and floating away.

**17. Make a quadruple batch of a casserole.**

Casseroles are nice, easy dishes to prepare, but on busy nights, itʼs often still easier to just order some take-out or eat out or just plop a prepackaged meal in the oven. Instead, the next time you make a casserole, [make four batches of it and put the other three in the freezer \[41\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/09/07/the-one-hour-project-make-a-quadruple-batch-of-a-casserole/). Then, the next time you need a quick meal for the family, grab one of those batches and just heat it up - easy as can be. Even better, doing this allows you to buy the ingredients in bulk, making each casserole cheaper than it would be ordinarily - and far, far cheaper than eating out or trying a prepackaged meal.

**18. Be diligent about turning off lights before you leave.**

If you spend one minute turning off lights before a two hour trip, thatʼ[s the equivalent of earning \$50 an hour \[42\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/11/18/how-much-money-does-turning-off-the-lights-really-save/). Thatʼs some impressive savings, particularly if you do it before longer trips. The key is to use less energy, particularly when youʼre not using the device.

**19. Swap books, music, and DVDs cheaply on the internet via services likePaperBackSwap.**

You can very easily swap the books and CDs and DVDs youʼve [grown bored with via the internet with others. Just use sites like PaperBackSwap \[43\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/03/paperbackswap-an-effective-way-to-save-money-on-books/), clean out your media collection, and trade them with others online. The best part? Youʼll [get a flood of new books (or CDs or DVDs \[44\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/07/05/seven-websites-that-saved-me-money-in-the-last-week/)) to enjoy, mailed right to you - for free.

**20. Maximize yard sales.**

I like to stop by yard sales if I see them, but I recognize that often the stuff there is junk. Thus, Iʼm careful about what I buy and I use clever tactics to [find it - and lower the prices \[45\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/11/12/six-things-i-look-for-at-yard-sales-and-how-i-get-them-even-cheaper/). That way, I wind up with a really big bargain - or else I can just walk away with the money in my pocket, having been entertained for a bit.

**21. Install CFL (or, even better, LED)bulbs wherever it makes sense.**

These bulbs might cost more initially, but they both have a longer life than normal incandescent bulbs and they both eat far less electricity. CFLs tend to use about 25% of the electricity of an incandescent [- LEDs use about 20% \[46\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/02/10/the-light-bulb-showdown-leds-vs-cfls-vs-incandescent-bulbs-whats-the-best-deal-now-and-in-the-future/). CFLs are cheaper than LEDs right now and produce better light, but not quite as good as incandescent bulbs. My policy? Put LEDs in closets and out of the way places, use CFLs for hall and some room lighting, and use incandescent bulbs (until the other bulbs get better) where you read and do other eye-intensive activities. This will trim a significant amount from your electric bill.

**22. Install a programmable thermostat.**

These devices regulate the temperature in your house automatically according to the schedule that you set. Thus, when youʼre not home, it allows the heating or cooling to turn off for several hours, saving you on your <amp-img width="240" height="171" layout="intrinsic" src="/assets/images/000004.png"></amp-img> energy bill. A programmable thermostat can easily cut your energy bill by 10 to 20% - and itʼ[s surprisingly easy to install \[47\]](http://frugaldad.com/2008/08/28/how-to-install-programmable-thermostat/).

**23. Buy appliances based on reliability, not whatʼs cheapest at the store.**

Itʼs worth the time to do a bit of research when you buy a new appliance. A reliable, energy efficient washer and dryer might cost you quite a bit now, but if it continually saves you energy and lasts for fifteen years, youʼ[ll save significant money in the long run \[48\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/07/24/the-true-monthly-cost-of-an-appliance/). When you need to buy an appliance, research it - start with back issues of Consumer Reports at the library. An hourʼs worth of research can easily save you hundreds of dollars.

**24. Clean your carʼs air filter.**

A clean air filter can improve your gas mileage by up to 7%, saving you more than \$100 for every 10,000 miles you drive in an average vehicle. [Plus, cleaning your air filter is easy to do in just a few minutes \[49\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/02/19/five-minute-finances-1-clean-your-cars-air-filter/) - just follow the instructions in your automobileʼs manual and youʼre good to go.

**25. Hide your credit cards.**

Take your credit cards and put them in a safe place in your home, not in your wallet where itʼs easy to spend them. If you argue that you need it for "emergencies," just be sure to keep a small amount of cash hidden in your wallet for these emergencies. Donʼt keep plastic on you until you have the willpower to not use it even when youʼre sorely tempted.

**26. Plan your meals around yourgrocery storeʼs flyer.**

Instead of just planning your meals based on a cookbook or whatever you can dream up, plan all your meals around whatʼs on sale in your grocery storeʼs flyer [\[50\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/10/16/how-to-plan-ahead-for-next-weeks-meals-and-save-significant-money-a-step-by-step-guide/). Look at the biggest sales, then plan meals based on those ingredients and what you have on hand, and youʼll find yourself with a supermarket. Photo by fazen much smaller food bill than youʼre used to.

**27. Do a price comparison - and find a cheaper grocery store.**

Most of us get in a routine of shopping at the same grocery store, even though quite often itʼs not the one that offers the best deals on our most common purchases. Fortunately, thereʼs a simple way to find the cheapest store around. Just keep track of the twenty or so things you [buy most often, then shop for these items at a variety of stores \[51\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/09/16/the-one-hour-project-price-compare-the-things-you-buy-regularly/). Eventually, one store will come out on top for your purchases - just make that one your regular shopping destination and youʼll automatically save money.

**28. Challenge yourself to try making your ownthings.**

Before I tried it myself, I thought homemade breadmaking was complicated and a waste of time and money. I came to find out that it [was pretty easy \[52\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/11/04/homemade-bread-cheap-delicious-healthy-and-easier-than-you-think/) and it was actually much cheaper, healthier, and tastier than buying a loaf from the store. Now, we rarely ever buy bread products at the store - and we save money by making that choice. Iʼve had a similar experience [with many other household staples, like laundry detergent \[53\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/15/how-to-make-your-own-laundry-detergent-and-save-big-money)[, cleaning supplies \[54\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/06/spring-cleaning-time-here-are-some-tips-for-cleaning-supplies-on-the-cheap/), [and oatmeal packets \[55\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/05/09/making-your-own-homemade-oatmeal-packets-a-visual-guide-and-cost-analysis/). Make it yourself - itʼs surprisingly fun and it almost always saves you money.

**29. Donʼt spend money just to de-stress.**

Quite often, I used to spend money just to wind down from a stressful day at work. Instead, Iʼve found that I quite often feel much better by going home and taking some quiet time just to stretch and then meditate. I end up feeling much more together, happy, and ready to face an evening with the kids in the right mindset than I ever would by just blowing some cash after work. Instead of spending to de-stress, try some basic meditation techniques, stretching, or yoga and see how you feel.

**30. Talk to your loved ones about what your dreams are.**

This seems like an odd way to save money, but think about it. If you spend time with the people you love the most and come to some consensus about your dreams, it becomes easy for you all to plan for it. If youʼre all planning and working together towards this dream, it becomes easier to stay focused on it and reach it. Set a big, audacious goal together and encourage each other to be financially fit - soon, youʼll find youʼre doing it naturally and your dreams are coming closer than ever.
