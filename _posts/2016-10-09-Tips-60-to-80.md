**60. Check out what your townʼs parks and recreation board has to offer**. My town has several wonderful parks, free basketball and tennis courts, free disc golf, trails, and lots of other stuff just there waiting to be used. You can go have fun for hours out in the wonderful outdoors, playing sports, hiking on trails, or trying other activities - and itʼs all there for free. All you have to do is discover it.

**61. Air up your tires.**

For every two PSI that all of your tires are below the recommended level, you lose 1% on your gas mileage. Most car tires are five to ten PSI below the normal level, so that means by just airing up your tires, you can improve your [gas mileage by up to 5% \[69\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/05/five-minute-finances-7-air-up-your-tires/). Itʼs easy, too. Just read your carʼs manual to see what the recommended tire pressure is, then head to the gas station. Ask the attendant inside if they have a tire air gauge you can borrow (most of them do, both in urban and rural settings), then stop over by the air pump. Check your tires, then use the pump to fill them up to where they should be. Itʼs basically free gas!

**62. Start a garden.**

Gardening is an inexpensive hobby if you have a yard. Just rent a tiller, till up a patch, plant some plants, keep it weeded, and youʼll have a very inexpensive hobby that produces a huge amount of vegetables for you to eat at the end [of the season \[70\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/03/27/spring-and-the-awakening-garden/). I like planting a bunch of tomato plants, keeping them cared for, then enjoying a huge flood of tomatoes at the end of the summer. We like to eat them fresh, can them, and make tomato juice, sauce, paste, ketchup, pasta sauce, and pizza sauce. Delicious (and very inexpensive)!

**63. Dig into your community calendar.**

There are often tons of free events going on in your town that you donʼt even know about. Stop by the local library or by city hall and [ask how you can get ahold of a listing of upcoming community events \[71\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/06/five-minute-finances-21-look-at-your-community-calendar/), and make an effort to hit the interesting ones. You can often get free meals, free entertainment, and free stuff just by paying attention - even better, youʼll get in touch with whatʼs going on around you.

**64. Take public transportation.**

If the cityʼs transit system is available near you, take it to work (or to play) instead of driving your car. Itʼs far cheaper and you donʼt have to worry about parking your vehicle. When I lived in a larger city, I bought an annual transit pass that actually paid for itself after less than two months of use compared to using an automobile - and after that, for ten months, I basically could ride to work (and to some events) for free. Thatʼs money in the bank.

**65. Cut your own hair.**

I can cut mine myself with a pair of clippers, for example. I just cut it really short every once in a while and donʼt worry about it too much. Just put a garbage bag over the bathroom sink, bust out the clippers and scissors, and get it done. Two or three cuts will pay for the clippers, and then youʼre basically getting free haircuts. With a bit of practice, you can make it look good, too.

**66. Carpool.**

Is there anyone that lives near you who works at the same place (or near the same place) that you do? Why not ride together, alternating drivers each day? You can halve the wear and tear and gas costs for your car - and for your acquaintance as well.

**67. Cut back on your oil changes.**

If youʼre methodically following your dealershipʼs recommendation and getting an oil change every 3,000 miles, you might want to take a peek at your carʼs ownerʼs manual. Most modern cars only need an oil change every 5,000 miles and many models use one even less frequently than that.

**68. Get a crock pot.**

A crock pot is perhaps the best deal on earth for reducing cooking costs in a busy family [\[72\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/08/the-art-of-the-slow-cooker/). You can just dump in your ingredients before work, put it on simmer, and dinner is done when you get home. There are countless recipes out there for all variety of foods, and every time you cook this way, youʼre saving money as compared to eating out.

**69. Do some basic home and auto maintenance on a regular schedule.**

Instead of just waiting until something breaks to deal with it, develop a monthly maintenance [schedule \[73\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/06/05/save-time-effort-and-money-with-a-monthly-home-and-auto-maintenance-checklist/) where you go around your home (and your car) and perform a bit of maintenance where itʼs needed. This little activity, taking you just an hour or two a month, will keep things from breaking down and help you see problems before they become disasters.

**70. Pack food before you go on a road trip.**

Have everyone pack a sack lunch for the trip. That way, instead of stopping in the middle of the trip, driving around looking for a place to eat, spending a bunch of time there, and then paying a hefty bill, you can just eat on the road or[, better yet, stop at a nice park and stretch for a bit \[74\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2009/03/22/saving-money-on-a-road-trip-with-kids/). Plus, youʼll save a lot of money and a fair amount of time this way.

**71. Go through your cell phone bill, look for services you donʼt use, and ditch**

**them.**

Sit down and go through each item on your bill and see if thereʼs anything there that you donʼt use, like a surfeit of text messages or web access or something to that effect. Then call your cell phone company and ask to have those services eliminated. Boom, youʼre saving money.

**72. Consolidate your student loans.**

Interest rates are quite low right now, so it might be worthwhile to consolidate your student loans into one low-rate package. Look into the various student loan consolidation packages - even a 1% reduction on a \$10,000 loan saves you \$100 a year - and your loan is probably bigger than that (and the rate cut you could get is probably bigger).

**73. When buying a car, go for late model used.**

These are typically cars coming straight off of leases, meaning they were cared for by reliable owners. Look at late model used first and foremost - and use those prices as your baseline when comparing older used cars and new cars (donʼt exclude those options - exceptional deals and particular market conditions might point you towards another option on occasion). My truck was purchased with this criteria and has lasted me several years already with only one significant issue - and I saved a ton of money on the purchase price over buying new. Only now is it beginning to show significant signs of aging - and with the money I saved on that purchase, I was able to get out of debt that much quicker.

**74. Hit the library - hard.**

Donʼt look at a library as just a place to get old books. Look at [it as a free place to do all sorts of things \[75\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/02/17/5-ways-your-local-library-can-transform-your-life-without-even-checking-out-a-book/). Iʼve used it to learn a foreign language, meet people, use the Internet anonymously, check out movies and CDs, grab local free newspapers, and keep up on community events. Best of all, it doesnʼt cost a dime.

**75. Use a simple razor to shave.**

Iʼve been a big advocate of the basic safety razor for [a long time \[76\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/21/the-simple-dollar-guide-to-shaving/), but thatʼs just one piece of the puzzle. For "normal" shaves, I just shave <amp-img width="168" height="306" layout="intrinsic" src="/assets/images/000015.png"></amp-img> in the shower and dry off the blade afterwards, using just soap for lather - incredibly cheap, since I only swap blades once every few weeks. The real moral of the story? Use a simple razor - not an expensive electric one that stops working in three years - and shave your face when itʼs wet. You can get a very good shave with some practice and save a lot of money over the long haul.

**76. Find daily inspiration for making intelligent**

**moves.**

Iʼm usually inspired by my children. Perhaps youʼre inspired to make changes by your spouse - or even by someone in the community you respect. Maybe itʼs just a personal goal, like an early retirement. Find something that makes you want to make positive changes, then use that person or thing [as a constant reminder \[77\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2008/06/28/finding-inspiration-for-financial-change/). Keep a picture of it in your wallet, in your vehicle, and on your bathroom mirror. Keep it in your mind as much as you possibly can.

**77. Find out about *all***



**of the benefits of your job.**

Most people arenʼt even aware of all of the benefits available to them. Spend some time with an HR person finding out about *all* [of the benefits of your job \[78\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/09/13/the-one-hour-project-dig-into-your-job-benefits/) - you might be surprised at what you might find. I found free tickets to sporting events, free personal improvement opportunities, and an optional employee match on some retirement funds that maximized the money I was socking away. This not only cut down on my own spending on things like sporting and community events and educational classes, but also improved my retirement plan.

**78. Make your own items instead of buying them.**

I like to make my own laundry [detergent \[79\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/15/how-to-make-your-own-laundry-detergent-and-save-big-money/)[and my own Goo-Gone \[80\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/05/the-frugal-geeks-toolbox/), for starters. I also like making Glade, [Windex, and Soft Scrub \[81\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/06/spring-cleaning-time-here-are-some-tips-for-cleaning-supplies-on-the-cheap/). In both cases, itʼs way cheaper than buying the commercial version. Hunt around for recipes - itʼs amazing how many things you can make at home in just a few minutes that saves a ton of money compared to the commercial version.

**79. Encourage your friends to do less expensive activities.**

This is often a tricky [thing to do, but there are a number of techniques you can try \[82\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/03/07/are-your-friends-always-spending-money-ten-frugal-activities-and-advice-on-how-to-suggest-them/). My favorite one is to be the first one to suggest something - that often gives you the power to steer the group towards things that are cheaper. If you can convince your friends to go to the park and shoot hoops instead of going golfing, those green fees are going to stay in your pocket.

**80. Donʼt speed.**

Not only is it inefficient in terms of gasoline usage, it also can get you [pulled over and cost you a bundle \[83\]](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/04/23/the-economics-of-speeding-or-how-i-got-a-ticket-this-morning/). Itʼs highly cost-efficient to just drive the speed limit, keep that gas in the tank, and keep the cops off your tail.
