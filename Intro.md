Beginning with the printing press, technological innovations have 
enabled the dissemination of more and more media forms over broader 
and broader audiences. This mass media built and maintained a unidirec- 
tional relationship between a few trained professional media producers and 
many untrained media consumers. This model, which reached its peak in the 
middle to late twentieth century, began to shift in the 1980s with the wide- 
spread use of photocopiers, home video cameras, and mixtapes and evolved 
further with desktop publishing, home computing, and increased Internet 
access. By the early 2000s, the cost of computers, software, and Internet 
access decreased, allowing individuals access to the same tools of produc- 
tion used by professionals. In this period, new media forms such as blogs 
and social networking sites have focused squarely on active audience partici- 
pation, uprooting the established relationship between media producer and 
media consumer. At the end of this first decade of the twenty- first century, 
the line between media producers and consumers has blurred, and the uni- 
directional broadcast has partially fragmented into many different kinds of 
multidirectional conversations. 

Access to tools and the invention of new media forms allow formerly 
passive media consumers to make and disseminate their own media. New 
technological frameworks have arisen that center on enabling this media 
creation: message boards, audience- driven review sites, blogs and comment 
systems, photo- and video-sharing websites, social networks, social news 
sites, bookmark-sharing sites, and microblogging platforms, to name some 
of the more prominent ones. These new frameworks have become more and 
more focused on enabling media creation, as this so-called amateur media 
becomes the raison d'etre of these very professional media organizations. 
These sites are pointless without audience participation: from the audience's 
perspective, in order to experience the site you have to become a media pro- 
ducer, and from the organizations' perspective, without audience production 
their sites will fail. These media forms include a spectrum of engagement 



from elaborate videos uploaded to YouTube to a simple "like" on Facebook. 
While old forms coexist with these new audience-driven forms and hybrids 
of the two, media participation is now part of media consumption. 

Despite the widespread participant engagement and scholarly interest in 
this phenomenon, it has no definitive name. It has been given many names, a 
selection of the most prevalent of which include the corporate media favorite 
"user-generated content," Henry Jenkins's media-industries-focused "conver- 
gence culture," Jay Rosens "the people formerly known as the audience," the 
politically infused "participatory media," Yochai Benkler's process-oriented 
"peer production," and Tim O'Reilly's computer-programming-oriented 
"Web 2.0." Each of these terms defines one separate aspect of the phenom- 
enon and does so from the specific point of view of the different actors in 
this system. In order to understand the system as a whole, it is necessary to 
understand each of these separate terms and the perspective it comes from. 

"User-generated content" stands out in this list of terms, as it refers to the 
material product, not the tools or process of this product's creation; it does 
address the author but only as an effect of its focus on the product, and it 
seems to retain a vision of a passive audience in which the users who are 
generating the content are not synonymous with the audience as a whole but 
are merely individual members of the audience that step into an intermedi- 
ate role. This corporate term is very popular with commercial media organi- 
zations looking to explain their business plans to investors, but it is reviled 
by many of these so-called users, foregrounding a general conflict over the 
line in the sand between amateurs and professionals. Derek Powazek decon- 
structs the term in his 2006 post "Death to User-Generated Content": 

User: One who uses. Like, you know, a junkie. 

Generated: Like a generator, engine. Like, you know, a robot. 

Content: Something that fills a box. Like, you know, packing peanuts. 

So what's user-generated content? Junkies robotically filling boxes with 
packing peanuts. Lovely. 1 

He then proposes yet another term for the phenomenon, "authentic 
media." His deconstruction is intentionally cartoonish, but it expresses its 
point: the term is machine-like and disregards the personal nature of the 
media these individuals are creating. 

As Henry Jenkins has argued in Convergence Culture, these new media 
forms converge with existing forms and with the media industries built around 
those forms, in an often uneasy coexistence. 2 These inversions of the tradi- 


tional amateur/professional dialectic blur clearly defined author and audience 
roles. Powazek's critique is rooted in a proindividual, anticorporate ethos that 
privileges the authenticity of the individual amateur creator, but four years 
after his post, professional content has become a much larger part of the social 
media ecosystem. One marker of this transition is the makeup of the all-time 
most viewed videos on YouTube: in July 2010 only three of the top-twenty 
videos were nonprofessional, and the majority of the professional videos were 
studio-produced, high-budget music videos added to the site in the previous 
eighteen months. This inversion is well represented by "Lonelygirli5," a series 
of amateur- style videos of a fictional teenage girl named Bree; though the main 
character was played by an actor, led by a team of independent directors/pro- 
ducers, for the first four months the YouTube channel claimed the videos to be 
the authentic work of a individual amateur. 3 The goal for many of these media 
creators, including the creators of "Longelygirli5," is to become professionals 
through their amateur participation in these social media platforms. 

Jay Rosen has theorized this phenomenon as a shift in audience and has 
contextualized this shift in terms of democratic theory. In his blog post of 
the same name, he speaks in the voice of "the people formerly known as the 
audience," who want to announce their active presence to the media and to 
let the media know that they are not going away (see Rosen, chapter 1 in this 
volume). Rosen closes his missive with a warning from "the people formerly 
known as the audience" that they are not just "eyeballs" that can be owned. 
Rather than thinking of "the people formerly known as the audience" as a 
market, Rosen wants the media to think of them as the public made real; in 
referring to the public, and the political processes that it implies, Rosen is 
engaging the same principles behind the term "participatory media." "Par- 
ticipatory media," and the closely related "citizen journalism," focus on news 
reporting and the political power involved with destabilizing the one-direc- 
tional broadcast from a reporter to an audience into a multivoiced conversa- 
tion among participants. 4 In discussions of "participatory media," participa- 
tion in the media-creation process is often correlated with participation in 
the political process. Yochai Benkler's term "peer production" refers to the 
collaborative process of creating media over software-mediated platforms of 
the networked information economy, such as Wikipedia, Digg, and Slash- 
dot. 5 Benkler's focus is on the process itself, including the presence of socially 
or technologically mediated rules and the possibility that these new pro- 
cesses are inherently more democratic. 

The term "Web 2.0" is derived from O'Reilly Media's Web 2.0 Confer- 
ence, first held in 2004. Tim O'Reilly, in his follow-up article "What Is Web 



2.o?" defines "Web 2.0" as an upgraded computer-programming model that 
has enabled a set of participatory websites built on lightweight server-based 
applications that move rich data across platforms. The dense computer-pro- 
gramming jargon in this last sentence highlights the industry white-paper 
origins of the term. The term "Web 2.0" describes the tools for making this 
new media; it does not address the process, product, author, or audience. 
Though it was coined to describe a specific type of web programming, its 
prevalence outside the coterie of geeks shows how influential the term has 
become. This popular buzzword has been widely adopted by the market- 
ing departments of Internet startups (supplanting the tainted "dot-com"), 
media outlets, and academics analyzing the phenomenon. In the process, 
the term has lost its tether to the web -programming models it espoused and 
has become just as closely linked to a design aesthetic and a marketing lan- 
guage. Emptied of its referent, it is an empty signifier: it is a brand. The many 
"Web 2.0 Bullshit Generator" web pages are poignant critiques of Web 2.0 
as brand. 6 These simple applications generate random short sets of Web 2.0 
terms. These phrases, such as "reinvent rss-capable communities," "incentiv- 
ize citizen-media blogospheres," and "beta-test embedded wikis," combine 
these buzzwords to create meaningless, but convincing, marketing materials 
for a hypothetical Web 2.0 site. The phrases seem to work by deploying the 
signs of hip inclusive social-medianess, and yet they don't actually mean any- 
thing: they are the manifestation of Web 2.0 as branding material. 

Each of these terms encapsulates a different aspect of, and comes from 
the different perspectives of the multiple actors of, the phenomenon of social 
media. This book uses the term "social media," both in the title and in this 
introduction. The goal of this book is not to argue for the term "social media" 
at the expense of all these other terms. The goal of this book is to bring 
examples from the multiple disciplines, perspectives, and agendas into one 
space. "Social media" is a broad enough term that it can encompass, while 
preserving, each of these perspectives and their respective terms. 

The essays in this book are divided into six thematic parts: "Mechanisms," 
"Sociality," "Humor," "Money," "Law," and "Labor." The one question that runs 
through every one of these essays is whether social media is a good thing: 
is it beneficial for democracy, culture, law, labor, and creative expression? 
The field of technology studies asks this question of every new technology; 
the implicit and explicit answers to this question often veer to the extremes 
of techno-utopia and techno-dystopia, and social media is no exception. 
Notable examples at the extreme ends of this dialectic include beatific works 
like What Would Google Do? 7 which walks through the hypothetical appli- 



cation wisdom of crowds-based algorithms to every possible area of society, 
to predictions of social destruction in works like The Cult of the Amateur: 
How Today's Internet Is Killing Our Culture. 8 While all the essays in this book 
address this theme in some way some focus on it more than others. The hope 
for sharing, expression, and the power of new web tools appears strongest in 
the writings of Chris Anderson, Tim O'Reilly, Jay Rosen, and Clay Shirky 
Conversely, C. W. Anderson, Ashley Dawson, Henry Jenkins, and Felix 
Stalder argue that the unfettered information flow, without the means to con- 
trol it, turns into a spectacle that does anything but build meaningful politi- 
cal, social, or labor relationships between individuals. 

The essays in part 1 provide analyses of the technical and social practices 
that lay the groundwork for social media. As discussed earlier, Jay Rosen 
speaks in the voice of "the people formerly known as the audience," who 
wish for the media makers to know that they exist and are not going away. In 
doing so, Rosen highlights the change in audience participation, with is the 
central shift in social practices; this social shift is enabled by technical shifts 
that are discussed by Tim O'Reilly. Yochai Benkler theorizes the social prac- 
tice of sharing, a fundamental requirement for social media. Benkler offers 
models for what can be shared and asserts that these sharing economies can 
self-organize the use of these surpluses better than an exchange economy can. 
Siva Vaidhyanathan charts the cultural influence of the open-source software 
model, touching on the power of copyrights and alternative licenses, which 
is discussed at length in the section on the law. Tim O'Reilly describes the 
software models that have enabled the creation of social media platforms. As 
described earlier, a change in software- development practices, from isolated 
desktop application to a collaborative web-based platform, defines Web 2.0. 
In the collaboratively written essay "What Is Collaboration?," Adam Hyde, 
Mike Linksvayer, kanarinka, Marta Peirano, Sissu Tarka, Astra Taylor, Alan 
Toner, Mushon Zer-Aviv, and I trace the contours and processes of collabo- 
ration from the weak associations to the strong bonds. 9 The essay argues that 
sharing is a necessary precondition for collaboration but that strong collabo- 
ration requires intentionality and coordination. 

Part 2 addresses how social media changes the social dynamics of its par- 
ticipants, danah boyd weighs the merits of being perpetually connected to 
a wireless network, and the information overload and responsibility that 
results from the deluge of information, boyd accepts the negative aspects of 
being always on in exchange for the positives, as many of us do, though psy- 
chologists and neuroscientists are beginning to reach different conclusions. 10 
C. W Anderson looks at journalism's changing perception of its audience and 



how that reflects both journalism's and the audience's relationship to democ- 
racy. The rise of the algorithmic journalism performed by content farms may 
satisfy the search-query-based needs of its readership, but it undermines the 
democratic effect of journalism. 

"Lulz" is the term of choice to describe the pleasure of the ends-justify- 
the-means pranks and humor that pervades chatrooms and image boards. 
E. Gabriella Coleman traces an alternate genealogy of hackers that does not 
start at MIT and end with open-source software but, rather, moves from 
phone phreakers through countercultural politics and ends with "Anony- 
mous," the lulz-seeking Internet trolls on 4chan's infamous lb I board. This 
alternate history presents a subculture of computer hackers birthed out- 
side the university and invested in politics and transgression. Patrick Davi- 
son traces the evolution of the meme from its origins in Richard Dawkins's 
writings on evolutionary biology to the fast- track transformations of Inter- 
net memes on the anonymous image boards of 4chan. For Davison, the key 
to the success of Internet memes and their generative nature is the explicit 
removal of authorship, which he calls the "nonattribution meme." 

In most histories, the Internet began as a self-defense mechanism for com- 
municating during a nuclear war. 11 In the late '80s and early '90s it became a 
haven for academics, geeks, and other subcultures of the command line. By 
the mid-'90S money and profit had taken over; the dot-com bubble and crash, 
the current Web 2.0 balloon, and the Great Recession have marked the Inter- 
net alternately as a profit machine and an epic failure as such. Though money 
appears at the edges of many of the essays here as an explicit goal, a constrain- 
ing factor, or an effect to be eliminated, Chris Anderson's "The Long Tail" takes 
it on directly, identifying one of the new business models of online retailers. 
These retailers stock inventories many times larger than those of brick-and- 
mortar stores. These long-tail businesses manage to make money off books, 
records, and other goods that were much too obscure for any previous retailer 
to stock, leading to a previously unimaginable number of audience choices. 
On the flip side, recent studies suggest that, though these businesses can profit 
from selling a very small amount of media objects from each of a very large 
number of creators, those creators may be worse off in this new system. 12 Other 
repercussions reverberate from these shifts in what we value and how we value 
it — including Anderson's exploration of free (as in beer) services in his book 
Free! Why $0.00 Is the Future of Business — the exponential growth in the cost 
of unique objects, and the rise of real economies for virtual goods. 13 

Lawrence Lessig and Fred von Lohmann address the way that the law 
impacts the creation of social media. Lessig's essay describes a shift in how 



our culture writes, and the way that copyright law is at odds with this shift. 
Lessig compellingly argues that "writing" has evolved to include sound and 
moving image but that the copyright law governing writing has not evolved 
to reflect this cultural shift. This conflict between social practice and legal 
precedent criminalizes these new forms of expression. Lessig calls for legal 
reform and for the embrace of the licenses created by Creative Commons, an 
organization he helped found. Creative Commons licenses allow creators to 
exercise the rights guaranteed to them under their copyright: instead of "all 
rights reserved," these works have "some rights reserved." This book and all 
its essays are Creative Commons licensed. Fred von Lohmann approaches 
this legal conflict by looking at the different way the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act (DMCA) treats these new forms of expression and how 
that affects their transmission. Existing laws governing non-Internet-based 
media distribution allow large monetary penalties for breaking "strict liabil- 
ity" copyright law, preventing the distribution of works that relies on fair-use 
provisions, unless the creator can prove compliance before distribution. The 
DMCA has a safe-harbor provision that allows sites like YouTube to pub- 
lish these works and requires them to maintain a mechanism to adjudicate 
claims by copyright holders after distribution. This has allowed an explosion 
of online content and has allowed some creators to identify who is not going 
to sue them, but it has also led to massive removals of media from sites such 
as YouTube. Fred Benenson and I consider the shifts in ideology and meth- 
odology when applying these licenses to cultural works. Benenson looks at 
the intricacies of applying software-derived free-culture ideology to non- 
fungible creative works. In arguing that not all cultural works should have 
the same license, Benenson identifies a key difference between the utilitarian 
software tools that pioneered these license models and nonfungible works 
that are not intended to be further modified. Extending this discussion, I 
present three case studies that explore the failures and successes of applying 
open-source methodologies to Creative Commons-licensed noncode proj- 
ects. Though this process takes its cues from software development, the arts 
and design communities have a different set of challenges in the process of 
creating peer-produced works. 

The creation of a participatory audience foregrounds labor dynamics; 
when an audience participates in creating the media that it consumes, it links 
audience dynamics and labor relations and sometimes renders them inter- 
changeable. Though these labor dynamics are more central in social media's 
production model, they are not new. Henry Jenkins has written extensively 
about fan culture and the tensions between creative fans and the proprietary 



media empires they are fanatical about. In his essay here, which comes from 
his book Convergence Culture, Jenkins articulates some of the pitfalls of fan 
culture online and the instability of the trust between creative Star Wars fans 
and LucasArts' wavering support for fan fiction online. Clay Shirky consid- 
ers the untold possibilities of our coming cognitive surplus. Cognitive sur- 
plus is the excess thought power available to society when we convert passive 
spectatorship into participation in social media. To put this massive capacity 
in context, the amount of time it has taken to create the entirety of Wikipedia 
is one hundred million hours, which is equivalent to the amount of time the 
population of the United States spends watching advertisements on televi- 
sion on any one weekend. Shirky sees this cognitive surplus, released from 
the drudgery of passive spectatorship, as a force (a workforce) that will trans- 
form media and society in ways we cannot yet conceive. Conversely, Felix 
Stalder considers the pitfalls of how our labor accumulates in databases and 
server farms. Stalder articulates how our labor is often exploited by the "sur- 
veillance economy" of analytics software and server logs. Lastly, Ashley Daw- 
son self-reflexively returns us to the very enterprise of this book: academic 
publishing. Starting from a letter from his editor at University of Michigan 
Press announcing its digital publication initiative, Dawson asks whether the 
shift to digitally published scholarship and other forms of computational- 
ism can really provide an escape from the dystopian reality of contemporary 
academic labors reduced budgets, informal labor exacerbated by the asym- 
metry of power-law relationships, pressures of publishing conglomerates 
exacted through journal subscriptions, and the outcomes-focused mandate 
on professors to publish or perish. Dawson does see potential in some initia- 
tives but warns that academics are unprepared for digital transformations. 
He emphasizes that technology, without changing the social context of its 
implementation, merely reinforces existing inequalities. 

The process by which this book was created could never have happened 
without the use of social media as a tool for creation. Most of the essays in 
this volume exist on the Internet in one form or another; they are included 
here by virtue of their Creative Commons licenses. It is because these works 
have been licensed with free-culture licenses that I can bring them together 
in this collection, excerpting a few, editing others for print, and remix- 
ing Lessig's Remix talk into a written essay. In other cases, I was able to ask 
authors to extend shorter blog posts or to codify informal presentations doc- 
umented by online video. The print form of these digital texts is but one of 
their transformations, transformations that you, the people formerly known 
as the audience, are free to continue: it is social media after all. 



Copyright and licensing is powerful but never simple: the chapters in this 
book are mostly licensed with Attribution ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) licenses, 14 
and after a thorough discussion, NYU Press agreed to license the book with an 
Attribution Noncommercial ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license. 15 You are free 
to transmit the whole book, to remix the book, to abridge or amend the book 
with more essays, or to translate the whole book into other languages or other 
media platforms, so long as you do so for noncommercial purposes and the 
work retains this same license. As each individual chapter has a license that per- 
mits commercial use, you can use all the chapters except this introduction and 
Henry Jenkins' chapter in any of the aforementioned ways, without the restric- 
tion on commercial use. You may use the Jenkins chapter, the title of the book, 
and this introduction for noncommercial uses. What form will your remix take?
