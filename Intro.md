**Introduction**

The cover of this document tells you the whole story. Everything you *really* need to know abut personal finance can be summarized in just one page. Spend less than you earn. Earn more. Live frugal. Do something sensible with the difference. Control your own destiny. All of the other writing out there on personal finance is just details. In fact, the rest of this document *is* just details. What you始ll find in the rest of this document is a lot of additional detail about the points made on the cover. Beyond that, this document is heavily footnoted. If you始re reading this document on a computer, you can click on those footnote numbers and immediately jump to online resources that expand upon that point. The hardest part of personal finance is just having the courage to take that first step.
